 * Sporks UptimeRobot Heartbeat Ping
 *
 * This script should be run every minute under crontab, and uses UptimeRobot's API to retrieve the
 * heartbeat url for each monitor associated with a discord shard. It will find these by requesting all
 * monitors which contain the string "Discord Bot Shard " in their name, and are of type 5 (heartbeat).
 * Once they are retrieved it will iterate them and match them to a regular expression by friendly name,
 * extracting the shard ID from the name. It then does two things:
 *
 * 1) Update the database to store the last uptimerobot heartbeat url to be pinged under infobot_shard_status
 *
 * 2) If the shard is both online and connected, ping the endpoint with a simple GET request to let
 *    uptimerobot know this shard is alive
 *
 * If this script does not ping one of the uptimerobot heartbeat endpoints for 4 minutes (two heartbeats)
 * then uptimerobot will POST to a discord webhook which causes an embed message in #status on the official
 * discord server.
 *
