# Sporks, the backchatting, learning, scriptable discord bot
This github project contains the source code for Sporks, the learning, scriptable Discord chat bot, written in C++ using the D++ library.
Remember you can still find my original perl/botnix version of Sporks on IRC at irc.chatspike.net!

## Supported Platforms

Currently only Linux is supported, but other UNIX-style platforms should build and run the bot fine. I build the bot under Debian Linux.

## Dependencies

* [cmake](https://cmake.org/) (version 3.13+)
* [g++](https://gcc.gnu.org) (version 8+)
* [D++](https://github.com/brainboxdotcc/DPP) (master branch)
* [nlohmann::json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) (included with D++)
* [duktape](https://github.com/svaarala/duktape) (master branch)
* [PCRE](https://www.pcre.org/) (whichever -dev package comes with your OS)
* [MySQL Client Libraries](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/c-api/) (whichever -dev package comes with your OS)
 
## Building

    mkdir build
    cmake ..
    make -j8
    
Replace the number after -j with a number suitable for your setup, usually the same as the number of cores on your machine.

## Database

You should have a database configured with the mysql schemas from the mysql-schemas directory. use mysqlimport to import this.

## Configuration

Edit the config-example.json file and save it as config.json. The configuration variables in the file should be self explainatory.

## Running

    cd my-bot-dir
    ./run.sh

run.sh will restart the bot executable continually if it dies. 

## Command line parameters

    ./bot [--dev|--test] [--members]
